   * obtrudeException(Throwable)
   * if task is done or not done it will force the task to be

   * you do not shutdown thread pool it won't exit at all.

   * join() and get() are the blocking calls, if done on
   * non-demon thread it will prevent non-demon thread from
   * exiting until completion and inturn keep the demon

   * Note: diff between get() and join() is get throws
   * checked exception where as join() throws unchecked
